# Create Release Pull Request Workflow Action

This is a [reusable GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows) that creates a pull request with [git-pr-release](https://github.com/x-motemen/git-pr-release).

Once this workflow creates a pull request, it notifies of you on Slack.

## Usage

1. Create a Slack Webhook URL from https://api.slack.com/apps.
2. Set the Slack Webhook URL as a [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
3. Add a workflow configuration file as like the following examples into you repository.

That's it!

### Examples

#### Scheduled workflow

If you want to run the workflow at 04:00 UTC on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the following example works.

```yaml
name: release-pr

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 4 * * 1,2,3,4,5'

jobs:
  call-workflow-passing-data:
    uses: smartbank-inc/release-pr-workflow/.github/workflows/release-pr.yml@main
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      slack_webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

#### Manual trigger

If you want to [run the workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow), the following example works.

```yaml
name: release-pr

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      override:
        description: 'If you want to override the existing pull request, enter "true"'
        required: false
        default: ''

jobs:
  call-workflow-passing-data:
    uses: smartbank-inc/release-pr-workflow/.github/workflows/release-pr.yml@main
    with:
      override: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.event.inputs.override != 'true' }}
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      slack_webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```
